## Requirements

The only requirement is a spack working instance. In particular `$SPACK_ROOT/bin/spack-python` has to be in the PATH.

# spack-allinone

Script for generating spack configuration files, i.e. `packages.yaml` and `compilers.yaml`, for all
the CDTs/CPEs available on the system on which the script is executed.

# spack-config

Modulefile template that checks if a CDT/CPE module is loaded and sets the environment variable
`SPACK_SYSTEM_CONFIG_PATH` accordingly (more info here https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/26735).
This instructs the (modern enough) spack instance to use generated configuration files giving access
to Cray provided system packages and compilers for the programming environment used.

Before using it by adding it to `MODULEPATH`, it should be edited so that `SPACK_CSCS_CONFIGS_ROOT` points
to the root of spack configuration folders for cdt/cpe generated by `spack-allinone.py`.
